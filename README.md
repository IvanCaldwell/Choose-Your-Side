This iOS project provides examples for using configurable, custom data sources for a `UITableView`. It also shows how to display content on a second screen using `UIScreen` and a second `UIWindow`. This can be done with either an external display plugged into the lightning port, or using an Apple TV with AirPlay screen mirroring.

I recommend you check out the starter project first to see an app that has been configured to simply show a table of values. Then examine the completed project to compare that single data source example with a different configuration that uses two different, custom data sources with the same table view. The completed project is also modified to show the cell's detail view on a second screen if one is present.

Happy coding! üíª
